# AX-Classic Repack Update

These are the current updates for the MySQL and quest scripts for the AX-Classic Repack that I am currently working on.  My goal is to get most of the bugs in the repack crushed and fix a few features for a more complete repack experience.  Later I will offer various configurations and tools to further customize the experience you are seeking for you and your friends.

I will be hosting update patches in the form of 7-ZIP files.  You can download the patches, or individual scripts as I update them.  Please remember, you must replace your quest directory with the patch, "\AXClassic-PEQ\axclassic\quests" NOTE: Please, ensure that you overwrite your quest directory and replace everything, make sure you don't just extract the zipped "quest" directory into your "quest" directory!

Primary AX-Classic, the Rathe Server, is updated and maintained by a great community of players.  I highly suggest you visit them and get to know them.

The repack was made by a fine gentleman by the name of leslamarch for his father.  All credit goes to him for the repack launcher. 

If you like the repack and would like to see the current live version of the server, please visit http://www.axclassic.com/

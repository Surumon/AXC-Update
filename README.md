# AX-Classic Repack Update

These are the current updates for the MySQL and quest scripts for the AX-Classic Repack that I am currently working on.  My goal is to get most of the bugs in the repack crushed and fix a few features for a more complete repack experience.  Later I will offer various configurations and tools to further customize the experience you are seeking for you and your friends.

I will be hosting update patches in the form of 7-ZIP files.  You can download the patches, or individual scripts as I update them.  Please remember, you must replace your quest directory with the patch, "\AXClassic-PEQ\axclassic\quests"

# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to make hosting and playing your own EQemu Server as easy and accessible to all players.

To further facilitate this idea, customizations to setup, scripts, and even custom content will eventually be available to all users.  There will not be an "official" server or "required" server that you must play on.  All this content will always now, and forever, be free for you.

#Note
This project will never attempt to be the current live state of the AX-Classic Rathe server.  It is only my goal to provide an easily accessible server, not duplicate the current build of AX-Classic.

=====

#Credits

Primary AX-Classic, the Rathe Server, is updated and maintained by a great community of players.  I highly suggest you visit them and get to know them.

The repack was made by a fine gentleman by the name of leslamarch for his father.  All credit goes to him for the repack launcher. 

If you like the repack and would like to see the current live version of the server, please visit http://www.axclassic.com/

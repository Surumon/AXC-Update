He asks for the impossible since there are no Orcs here at all. I think i got a deal for you that could benefit both of us, you see? I have been hunting Orcs for many years in the Commonlands. I sold all the other stuff but i got some Orc Ribcages left. I would be willing to part with one if you could bring me 2 Lightstones, my wife is collecting those and i could really use some bonuspoints with her.. Now go get me the stones! ");

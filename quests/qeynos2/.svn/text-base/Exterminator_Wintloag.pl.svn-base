If you see some of them running around, keep the rat whiskers, and I will reward you for every four you bring me. I can also trade your beetle legs for spider legs if you ever may need them. Just give me one at a time. Did you see how Fippy Darkpaw tried to evade Qeynos on his own HAHAHA the stupid fool, it worries me though, it could be some form of deversion for a real attack. Please bring me the Blackburrow battle plans so we know what they are up to, those darn dog faces. If you do I would part with this Orc ribcage I picked up from East Commonlands.");

His writing has become illegible in his old age, but he shall clarify what it is he needs you to do.  Do as he says, child, and perhaps you will prove yourself a bit more worthy than the rotting flesh he will most likely have you return to him.");

I trust that you will keep your eyes to yourself in this matter.  Now go, and please travel within the veil of night, so you will not be seen by those whose minds are still clouded with delusions of Erudin's grandeur.");

The problem is, I had to carve a way out, and left a few extra holes in several of Hanns' people. I have been trapped down here in these stinking catacombs and sewers for too long now, and I do not think I can get out of here without some help.");

In any case, I can't get back out to West Karana to meet my contact, and I was paid quite a lot of money to do this job. I hate having unfinished business.");

Just give him the pouch, and tell him I was.. delayed.  While you are doing that, I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole. With any luck, the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away. That means they won't be looking for me here.");

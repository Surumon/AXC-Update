The lures that I have now are made of low quality Acrylia and scare the fish away rather than attract them.  I want to make a new lure. and on my way in I noticed the dull color of the [scorpions].  I would have moved closer to them but unfortunately  I am deathly allergic to the poisons found in scorpion venom.");

It gathers those that stand for chaos and disorder and is sending them out to search for the ultimate power of the Immortals, but it cannot be real. History reveals that he has been defeated. I see this same dream every night. It haunts me greatly. This dream seems too real, however, to not have some truth to it. If only I knew if this was a gift of foresight, or if I have finally lost my mind. If I only knew, I would be able to rest again. Please find a way to let me know if this is fact or fiction, $name .");

Some students that wanted to learn the ways of the Celestial Fists were looking for it a while back. One was a pirate that wanted to only learn the Path of the Silent to gain more treasures then he had. The other, wanted to become the most powerful fighter alive. You may want to seek them out and see if they have located pieces of it. I am sorry I could not be of more help. If you do happen to locate the two pieces, bring them back to me and maybe I will be able to aid you further. Now that you know my secret, there is no reason to remain hidden from the world. You will be able to find me resting in the Plane of Tranquility. Be safe, $name .");

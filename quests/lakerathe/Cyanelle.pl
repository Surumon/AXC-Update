Sometimes I wonder why I still share this tower with him. I suppose I get lonely on this lake, and Jebeker here never has much to say. But I digress. Eldreth will be back sooner rather than later, I would think. You are welcome to stay here and keep me company until he returns, or you can check back later. He is seldom gone more than a few days.");

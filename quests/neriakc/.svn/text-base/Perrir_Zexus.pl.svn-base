They could never succeed in their task with their feeble powers granted by their insignificant god, yet still, they are a nuisance. Bring me four of the holy symbols worn by the druids and I shall grant you the initiate symbol of Innoruuk. If you feel you are not yet powerfull enough for such a grant task you should see High Priestess Alexandria first, for some further training");

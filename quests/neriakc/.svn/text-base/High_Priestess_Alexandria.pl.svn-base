However, if you have the willingness and determination to serve your God then there might just be more hope for you then I would have thought. Obviously, to move forward in your training, you will need to shield yourself from your enemies and from the elements. I believe I have something that could help you if you are still $interested in proving yourself");

I have the molds necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest $helms, $bracers, $boots, $armguards, $greaves, $gauntlets and $breastplates. However there are some $important items that you will need to collect before the molds will be of any use to you. One thing to keep in mind is that I suggest you let me craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items needed for that specific recipe. Also bear in mind that the molds needed are 1 platinum pieces each, exept for the breastplate that mold costs 2 platinum.");

The most important component that you will need to collect while adventuring in the forest are Helms that are only worn by Priests of Rodcet Nife. These vile creatures have set up camp in the forest from what I have heard and it is your responsibility to find and execute them. These helms will be your most important component that you will gather because I have to use it in all armor recipes, as the metal that I will forge your armor with.");
